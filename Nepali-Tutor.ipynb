    "# Large Language Model Tutor for Global Minority Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a great deal of interest in applications ranging from homework help to global domination.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most exciting possibilities for LLMs is their application to problems of knowledge accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies like DuoLingo and Khan Academy are leveraging LLMs and other forms of machine learning to provide a replacement for a human tutor. However, there is a dearth of learning resources available for global minority languages, that is, languages that are not among the languages most widely spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such language is Nepali. Nepali is spoken natively by 16 million people and is used as a second language by an additional 9 million, yet it is rarely available as an option for machine translation and LLMs do not cater to its speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before effective tools can be made for the Nepali speaking population, it must also be possible for engineers and data scientists to learn Nepali.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will endeavor to create an AI Nepali tutor. The tutor should be able to understand English language sentences from its student and provide Nepali translations of those sentences. Additionally, it should be able to generate novel sentences in English and provide Nepali translations of those sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, Nepali uses the Devanagari script: a form of writing unfamiliar to many English speakers, especially in the west. Thus, the student should be able to provide an unfamiliar sentence in Nepali, written in this script, and receieve a translation from the tutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I will train a series of models. The first will generate novel sentences in English. The second will translate English sentences to Nepali. The third will translate written Nepali into written English. Finally, the fourth model will generate text from spoken English sentences."
