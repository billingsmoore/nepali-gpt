    "# Large Language Models for Global Minority Languages\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a great deal of interest in applications ranging from homework help to global domination.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most exciting possibilities for LLMs is their application to problems of knowledge accessibility. Much effort has been devoted to, for example, the translation of natural language into SQL, a coding language used to query large databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can also summarize long documents which may be difficult to comprehend for individuals with learning differences. Additionally, LLMs can be used to rephrase complex or jargon-heavy writing for individuals without a large amount of expertise in a given subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these things present the possibility of a great leap forward for information accessibility. However, LLMs are almost exclusively developed in English and other majority languages. This leaves a significant gap for those who speak languages that are in the global minority.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such language is Nepali. Nepali is spoken natively by 16 million people and is used as a second language by an additional 9 million, yet it is rarely available as an option for machine translation and LLMs do not cater to its speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I will attempt to create a first draft of solution and a potential template for similar projects that could cater to other global minority language groups."
